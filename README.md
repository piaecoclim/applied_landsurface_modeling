# 🌍 Simple Water Balance Model (SWBM)

Final version of the model developed during the **Applied Land Surface Modeling** course (SoSe 2025). A general workflow of the model can be found [here](workflow.jpeg).

### ✅ Features
- Snow dynamics based on temperature threshold and melt coefficient
- Dynamic evapotranspiration coefficient ($\beta_0$) influenced by Leaf Area Index (LAI) and temperature
- Modular and fully vectorized with `xarray` and `apply_ufunc`

### 🗂️ Data Overview

All input data has:
- **Spatial resolution**: 0.5°
- **Temporal range**: 2000–2023  
- 📦 Download: [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V765zRx40aa4dfW-wJSSS-9CB0W1tfSI?usp=sharing)

**Datasets used:**
- **LAI**: MOD15A2H.061 (originally 8-daily, linearly interpolated to daily)
- **ERA5**: Daily average temperature, net radiation, and total precipitation

### 🔧 Setup Instructions

#### 1. Install Conda (if not installed):  
👉 [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

#### 2. Create the environment from `.yml` file:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

to activate the environment:

```
conda activate your-env-name
```

Once everything is set up you need to modify the <code> data_path & output_path </code> within the waterbalancemodel.py file. And then run python waterbalancemodel.py in the python environment.
